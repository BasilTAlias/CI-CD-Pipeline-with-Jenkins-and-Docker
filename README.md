# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline automates the process of deploying a website using a Docker container.

## Overview

- **Jenkins Server**: Used for continuous integration and deployment.
- **Docker Server**: Used to containerize the website and serve it using Nginx.

## Prerequisites

- Two EC2 instances (one for Jenkins and one for Docker)
- Jenkins installed on one EC2 instance
- Docker installed on the other EC2 instance
- GitHub repository to store the website files
